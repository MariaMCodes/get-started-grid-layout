        <!--We can achieve the same result as in example 2 using a shorthand syntax declaring the start and end values at once. Values are separated with a / and again it would be valid to omit the / and the end value as we are spanning only one track. CHECK CSS NOTES-->

        <!--Line-based placement shorthand - grid-area-->

        <!--We can achieve the same result as in example 2 and 3 declaring all four values with the grid-area property. Again values are separated with a /. The order of the values is row-start/column-start/row-end/column-end. CHECK CSS NOTES-->

    <!--Line-based placement named lines-->

    <!--We can name lines rather than targeting them by number. Name the line inside brackets. In the code below you can see that I name the very first column line col1-start then comes the 100 pixel first column track. Having named the lines you can use the names, rather than numbers.

You always have the line numbers to use - even if you name some or all of your lines.-->

        <div class="item aa">A</div>
        <div class="item bb">B</div>
        <div class="item cc">C</div>
        <div class="item dd">D</div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!--Line-based placement named lines with spans-->

    <!--You can give lines the same name and then use the span keyword to target lines of a certain name. This is really useful if you want to create a complex grid with multiple content tracks and gutters.

I have made a slightly larger grid here and have named all of the Grid Lines before the content tracks with col and all of the lines before the row tracks with row. I can then start at a certain column line by using col <line number> and span by saying span <number of lines>.-->
